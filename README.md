1. We can detect Dyslexia in 3 phases (__PhaseI__ : Eye tracking phase __PhaseII__ : comprehension phase __PhaseIII__: Quizing Portal) After undergoing these tests we are going to detect this disorder.
1. There is a special type of open dyslexic fonts which can be used to help those students suffering from this disorder. We are converting any common book into the book with this font which can be printed or can be used as a pdf.
1. The biggest problem in india or some other developing countries are lack of awareness about this disorder due to which maximum people start giving their wards medications which further deterioriates the health as well as the confidence level of the ward. So we have also incorporated the Blog which will have every type of informations regarding this disorder.
